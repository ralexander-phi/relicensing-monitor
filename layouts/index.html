          An open source software "rug-pull" occurs when a project changes its license to something non-open source.
          This is often done so that the project trademark owner can better monetize the project.
          Developer communities that provided their work to the project are often upset when this happens and may stop collaborating with the project.
          License changes do not apply retroactively to previous releases, so developers may consider forking the project under a new name and with an open source license.

          <a href="/projects/redis/">Redis</a> and <a href="/projects/terraform/">Terraform</a> are recent examples of open source projects that were relicensed as non-open source projects.

          This site seeks to educate developers and users about risks that their favorite open source projects may be relicensed unfavorably.
