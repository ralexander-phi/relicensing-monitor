# Public Good

## Nonprofit Organizations and Charities

A nonprofit organization is founded around a specific charitable or socially beneficial mission.
Nonprofits are often funded through donations and grants.
Many countries provide tax benefits to such organizations.


## Open Source Mission

Developing open source software is one way that a nonprofit organization can provide public benefit.
When an organization uses "open source" as part of their mission statement, they are deterred from relicensing software under non-open source licenses.
Relicensing software could:

* frustrate philanthropists
* violate terms of grants; or
* impact tax-exempt status

As such, nonprofit organizations which define a public benefit mission related to "open source" receive lower risk scores in the Relicensing Monitor model.


## Competing Missions

When "open source" is not part of an organization's mission there are fewer obstacles preventing relicensing.
Switching to commercial licensing and collecting software licensing revenue could help the nonprofit fund their core public benefit mission.
A nonprofit could feel motivated to switch to commercial licensing to supplement their funding.
As such, the lower risk rating is not applied to all nonprofits.
